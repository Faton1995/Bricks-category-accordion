The aim of this element should be the following:
	- Dynamic categories: Automatically displays all categories and subcategories of your selected taxonomy.
	- Customizable styling: Customize typography, colors, icons and layout directly in the Bricks Builder.
	- Interactive Accordion: Users can expand and collapse categories to view subcategories.
	- Fully integrated into Bricks: Take advantage of the Nestable Elements API for maximum flexibility.

 I created this with ChatGPT. I hope that an experienced Bricks Builder developer can help me to make this Bricks element work and make it available to the public.
